# My Motivations

Over the past few years, I’ve dived into an array of exciting technologies, experimenting and building various projects along the way. One such technology is <span class="text-orange-600">Astro</span>, which now powers this very blog.

Looking back, I wish I had kept a detailed log of all the projects I worked on. This blog is my attempt to remedy that. Here, I’ll be documenting my projects, sharing insights, and reviewing the tech I’m exploring at any given moment.

Stay tuned for a lot of cool content as I chronicle my journey through the world of tech!
